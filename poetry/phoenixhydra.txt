The phoenix and the hydra:
Eternal rivals, in struggle
since history began.
The hydra reveals a great many heads.
When one
is removed, it grows
another two.
To vanquish the beast, to overcome this epoch,
decapitation, deliverance
must be of
infallible and absolute quality.

The sickle, 
gives the widest cut.
The hammer,
turns its corpse to dust. 

The phoenix follows
the path to liberation
of all peoples colonized
and imprisoned
in the land beyond the hydra’s walls.
When felled,
it is reborn from
the ashes of its pyre;
Its funeral songs become
songs of war, 
then 
songs of triumph.

The mighty
and immortal phoenix
unfurls its shining wings. It takes flight.
The red sun rises.

Forward. March to the light
of the phoenix. Do not fear the
shadow of the hydra.
The phoenix is the
iron in our blood, our
beacon in the heart of the storm.
Our mother, and
Our father.

Behold. The brilliant gold
of the revolution.
Black clouds burning
apart, as it sets the whole sky
aflame. The whole land is shimmering!
