/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h2>What Is Survivalism? What Is <em>Left</em>-Survivalism?</h2>
    <p>Survivalism is a movement of preparedness. Survivalists prepare for any kind of emergency, from social unrest to catastrophic failure. However, the survivalist movement is primarily dominated by Christians, rightists, and right-militias. This is why I seek to separate survivalism into right-survivalism and left-survivalism (and form left-militias).</p>
    <p>I am a left-survivalist. Left-survivalism is, roughly, revolutionary socialist ideology infused in the praxis of survivalism. </p>
    <p>My target audience is comrades of the imperialist core, but I want to expand this audience to include survivors of imperialism in the periphery zones, and comrades facing the threat of imperialist war in the near-future. It is my hope that left-survivalism serves to promote preparedness and security culture throughout the whole socialist movement, as a means of building a wider culture of resistance in the Third-Worldist sense.    </p>
    <p>My first objective is to  form a collective for the development of left-survivalism. If youâ€™re interested in joining, <a href="mailto:dzhonmuchenik@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Future objectives:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Form the Organizing Committee for a Revolutionary Left-Survivalist Movement. </li>
      <li>Draft our Basic Points of Unity and Programme. </li>
      <li>Develop the advanced revolutionary ideology and praxis of left-survivalism.</li>
      <li>Transform the Organizing Committee into a larger Revolutionary Left-Survivalist Movement of many groups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Preliminary documents, resources:</strong>
    <p>The following documents are being written by myself personally, as a precursor to the foundational documents that the future RLSM(OC) has a responsibility to draft, collectively. Documents herein are missing, but are forthcoming:
    <ul>
      <li>A List Of Realistic,  Foreseeable Disaster Situations</li>
      <li>The Revolutionary Left-Survivalist Movement - <em>Who? Why? How?</em></li>
      <li>Basic L-S <em>#1</em>: Gear We&rsquo;d Need, Framework For Our Command Structure, And Base-Building <em>101</em><br />
      </li>
      <li>Offsite: <a href="http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/Active_FM.html" target="_blank">A Collection Of Field Manuals And Technical Manuals</a> [.gov]</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em><a name="whyrlsm" id="whyrlsm"></a>Why RLSM?</em></h3>
    <p>RLSM aims to be a component of the <a href="http://revolutionaryaim.org/" target="_blank">Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement</a>, an organization devoted to expanding the creative application of <em>RAIMism</em>. RAIM encourages a great deal of creativity, integrity and discipline, and it is our belief that RLSM is a creative application well-suited for helping to build the subjective forces for revolution on the following grounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>RLSM can bring comrades face-to-face and introduce them to a new and challenging environment.</li>
      <li>RLSM can teach comrades basic (and advanced) guerrilla and survival techniques that one needs in order to respond to  calls for armed insurrection and<em>/</em>or relief of local, regional and global disasters (crises of capitalist-imperialism?).</li>
      <li>RLSM can build <em>real </em>camaraderie, discipline and organizational unity, by functioning as a strict military-style operation, communist-in-character, founded upon revolutionary anti-imperialist (and Third-Worldist) principles.</li>
      <li>RLSM can lead by example, by entering communities of poverty and OnkwehÃ³n:we land reservations to provide material aid, moral support and promote revolutionary, anti-imperialist (and nat.-lib.) ideas among the masses, and to build allyship <strong>â€“</strong> as well as to gather the ideas of the masses and package them upward.
        <ul>
          <li>In essence, RLSM can leave the &ldquo;city&rdquo; and enter the &ldquo;countryside&rdquo;. <br />
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>RLSM can help &ldquo;unpack&rdquo; <em>RAIMism</em>, and deliver packages from the masses to the RAIM HQ.
        <ul>
          <li>In my view of RLSM, I see it as being an international network of  local cells, taking advanced orders from RAIM Chapters and helping RAIM Chapters in concentrating the ideas of the masses. Our work serves to build a trained pro-people force <em>and </em>anti-state force of the people, a Peopleâ€™s Army at an early stage.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>During downtime, comrades of RLSM can study M(TW) and NL, thereby developing their political consciousness. </li>
